# Flare: Progressive streaming of large datasets

Flare is a simple protocol for streaming large datasets over HTTPS. It revolves around splitting a dataset into small chunks and storing the chunk URLs within a playlist file. The playlist can then be used to read any part of the dataset without loading the whole file into memory ðŸ¥³ðŸ‘Œ.


## Introduction

Flare takes inspiration from multimedia streaming formats such as [M3U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U) and [PLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLS_(file_format)), which split a single stream into several chunks; allowing applications to download only the parts they need. Chunking also allows streams to be hosted on multiple servers for greater redundancy, storage capacity, and download rates (i.e. CDNs). 

Flare aims to bring these benifits to the data science domain.


## Playlists

At the core of Flare, are *playlists*. These are lightweight YAML files which store the locations of stream chunks and other metadata. Playlists have the following structure:

```yaml
<Stream 0 Name>:
    headers:
        ...
    content:
        - <Chunk 0 URL>
        - <Chunk 1 URL>
        - ...

<Stream 1 Name>:
    headers:
        ...
    content:
        - <Chunk 0 URL>
        - <Chunk 1 URL>
        - ...
...
```

     
### Streams

A playlist consists of one or more *streams*. Streams typically encompas a single object within a dataset - for example in a supervised learning dataset, one stream might be used to store inputs while another is used to store labels.


### Headers

Stream headers are used to communicate metadata about a stream to clients. For example, they may indicate how stream chunks have been encoded or provide a natural language description of the stream. While stream headers are completely arbitrary, we recommend following the conventions described [here](https://github.com/oelin/flare-guidelines#stream-headers).


### Content

Streams also contain an array of chunk URLs which denote where each chunk can be downloaded from.


## Conclusion

Flare is a simple protocol for streaming large datasets over HTTPS. We hope that it makes sharing big data less of a hassle for ordinary internet users.
