# Flare: Flexible, streamed access to big datasets

Flare provides streamed access to big datasets by partitioning them into bite-sized chunks which can be read asynchronously. The locations of stream chunks are held in lightweight YAML files called *playlists*. Given a playlist, any portion of a dataset can be read without loading the whole file into memory ðŸ¥³ðŸ‘Œ.


## Introduction

Flare takes inspiration from multimedia streaming formats such as [M3U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U) and [PLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLS_(file_format)) to simplify access to vast amounts of data on limited devices. The chunk abstraction allows applications to download only those portions of a dataset which they require *at runtime* and minimize unneccessary memory usage. Many client implementations further makes use of layered LRU caching to minimize read latency and prevent storage space exhaustion.


## Playlists

At the core of Flare, are *playlists*. These are lightweight YAML files which hold the locations of stream chunks and other metadata. Playlists have the following structure:

```yaml
<Stream 0 Name>:
    headers:
        ...
    content:
        - <Chunk 0 URL>
        - <Chunk 1 URL>
        - ...

<Stream 1 Name>:
    headers:
        ...
    content:
        - <Chunk 0 URL>
        - <Chunk 1 URL>
        - ...
...
```

     
### Streams

A playlist consists of one or more *streams*. Streams are typically used to encompas a single *variable* or *object* within a dataset - for example in a supervised learning dataset, one stream may be used for inputs while another is used for labels. Streams have a name, headers and content, which are described below.


#### Headers

Stream headers are used to communicate metadata about a stream towards client applications. For example, they may indicate how stream chunks have been encoded or provide a natural language description of the stream. While these headers can be completely arbitrary, we recommend following the conventions described [here](https://github.com/oelin/flare-guidelines#stream-headers).


#### Content

Streams also contain an array of chunk URLs which denote where each chunk can be downloaded from.


## Conclusion

Flare is a simple, flexible format for streaming big datasets to limited devices. Our hope is that it positively contributes to the democratization of big data.
